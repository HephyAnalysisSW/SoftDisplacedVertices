# SoftDisplacedVertices
Framework for Soft Displaced Vertices analysis.

This package is current in a very preliminary stage. Tracks are selected and passed to the Inclusive Vertex Finder to reconstruct secondary vertices.

The package takes AOD file as input and output a ROOT file (MINIAOD-like) that include selected tracks and secondary vertices.
